# Solar System

## Introduction

<br>
Solar System is a sound visualizer that takes input from both microphone in real time and a ChucK program. I try to depict a solar system and the system becomes chaotic with the changes of audio input.

The 'flame' around the sun represents the signal in time domain. And the orbits around the sun represent the signal in frequency domain and show the history of frequency.
