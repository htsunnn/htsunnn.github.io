# Strange Amusement Park

## Introduction

<br>
The name for my program is called strange amusement park. It's a music sequencer that is composed of several rides in an amusement park. Each ride can make a unique sound and I can control the tempo to compose a piece of music.

The Ferris Wheel can make a sound of gear rotating; the pirate boat creates a sound of wave; the turbo drop makes a sound of people screaming; and the bumper car just makes the sound of bumping.
