# Online Code Judge

## Introduction

<br>
In this project, I designed and implemented an online judge for programming problems which support multiple users to edit the code simultaneously.  I built a single-page web application which displays coding problems and includes a code editor in it using Angular. And different users could write codes in one same editor by using web socket to communicate with each other. In addition, I implemented a code executor service which enables the users to run their codes online.
