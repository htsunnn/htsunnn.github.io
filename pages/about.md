# **About Me**

Hi I'm **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>

A programmer and product manager studying at Stanford University. I'm pursuing a master degree in computer music which is the intersection of computer science, art and design.

I would like to apply my technical skills solve the problems our daily lives, creating the value and exploring the unknown. My interests include technology, sports and music.
